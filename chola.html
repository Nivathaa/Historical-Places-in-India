 <h3>The Great Living Chola Temples in Tamil Nadu are a group of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the epitome of artistic and architectural 
excellence. They are one of the top historical places in India that were built by the kings of the Chola Empire, a powerful empire that 
stretched all over South India and the neighboring islands. The three great temples are Brihadeshwara Temple at Tanjore, Airavateshwara Temple
 in Darasuram, and Brihadeshwara Temple in Gangaikonda Cholapuram. </h3><h3>
Every one of these temples reflects the outstanding achievements of the Chola Empire in sculpture, architecture, painting, and bronze 
casting. One of the examples of that is the 24meters vimana and a stone image of Shiva at Darasuram. The incredible gopurams of these temples
along with the sculptures inside them really win oneâ€™s heart.</h3>
<h4>DO YOU KNOW? It is believed that Raja Raja Chola got the inspiration to build the Brihadeshwara Temple at Tanjore from his visit to 
SriLanka.</h4>
<h4>Timings: You can visit the temples from 6:30 am to 8:30 pm. The temples, however are shut from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm<br>
