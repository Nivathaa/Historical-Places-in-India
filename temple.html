<h3>The history of Konark Sun Temple and sun worship goes as far back as the 19th century BC. The Konark Sun Temple, however, was built in the
 13th century. The historic region of Kalinga which comprises major parts of modern-day Odisha and several parts of Chhatisgarh, Andhra Pradesh,
and West Bengal, was ruled by the rulers of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty from 5th Century AD to 15th Century AD.</h3>       
<br> <h3>Built by the great ruler of the Ganga dynasty â€“ King Narasimhadeva I, along with 1200 artisans, the Konark Temple is magic set in stone.
Located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, this temple signifies the exquisite detailing of ancient architecture and is one of the famous 
historical places in India. A particularly interesting feat is at the entrance of the temple where two lions are shown crushing elephants and a
human body lies at the foot of the elephant.</h3SSS>
