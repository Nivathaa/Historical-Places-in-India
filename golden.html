<h3>Golden Temple, located in the city of Amritsar in Punjab. Also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, the Golden temple is the most important 
 religious site for the Sikhs, and celebrates humanity, tranquillity and brotherhood. Spread across two storeys, the gurdwara has a unique
  domed architecture, with the dome-part of it completely covered in pure gold, while the other half is made out of white marble. </h3><h3> 
In addition to seeing major attractions like the Akal Takht, Sikh History Museum, Clock Tower and the Teja Singh Samundri Hall, you can also 
enjoy the daily Langar here, which attracts thousands of devotees and visitors every day.</h3>
