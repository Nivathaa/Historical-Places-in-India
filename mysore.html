<h3>You cannot fathom the greatness of the Mysore Palace unless you come face to face with it. The grandness of its proportions would have you
believe that the palace had sprung out of a fairytale. It was built by the British architect Lord Henry Irwin in 1912. Mysore Palace was
 built in Indo-Saracenic style and featured intricate interiors.</h3>
<h3> The interiors of the palace are adorned with ornate ceilings, jeweled corridors, stained glass windows and open mandaps. You also come
 across several Wadiyar memorabilia, including the jeweled throne. Mysore Palace also hosts the festivities of Dasara festival. Explore Mysore
