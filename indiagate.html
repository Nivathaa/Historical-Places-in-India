<h3>One of the top historical buildings in India, the India gate is situated on the Rajpath and was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. 
Committed to the 82,000 troopers of both Indian and British drop who battled in World War One and 13,300 fighters who were martyred in the 
Third Anglo-Afghan War, it was completed in 1931.
</h3>
<h3> Consistently, the Republic Day Parade is held here. It is one of the most popular monuments in India among the local people
